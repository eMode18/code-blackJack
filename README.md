# TypeScript Project: Blackjack Card Game

This document contains the instructions for a take-home project involving implementing a
blackjack card game. This will be a simplified version of the game that involves no splitting,
doubling down or surrendering. The only available options for the player will be to “hit” or
“stand”.

## Project Description

Code a simplified version of Blackjack in TypeScript, focusing on fundamental programming
concepts and TypeScript's features. This project is designed to familiarize you with TypeScript
syntax, object-oriented programming, and basic game development concepts within a Node.js
environment. This project should be completed as a command line application that uses
Node.js.

## Collecting User Input

To collect user-input in node.js you can use the npm package: prompt-sync. You can install it
using the below commands:

```bash
npm install prompt-sync
npm i --save-dev @types/prompt-sync
```

To collect input you’ll need to use the following code snippet:
import promptSync from 'prompt-sync';

```typescript
const prompt = promptSync();
// Ask for the user's name
const name = prompt("What is your name? ");
```

## Shuffling The Cards

To shuffle an array of elements (the cards) you can use this code snippet.

```typescript
function shuffleArray(array) {
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    // Generate a random index from 0 to i
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    // Swap elements at indices i and j
    [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
  }
  return array;
}
// Example usage:
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log("Original array:", myArray);
const shuffledArray = shuffleArray(myArray);
console.log("Shuffled array:", shuffledArray);
```

## Explanation of the Game

Blackjack, often known as 21, is a card game where the player competes against the dealer
with the goal of having the total value of their cards come as close to 21 as possible without
exceeding it. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the game works and the rules you'll
implement:

### Game Setup:

- The game uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
- Each card has a value:
- Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10.

- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the
  player's hand the most.
- The player starts with a bankroll of $100.
- Before each round, the player places a bet. If the player runs out of money, the
  game ends.

### Game Flow:

- Placing Bets: The player decides how much to bet from their available funds.
- Dealing Cards: Initially, both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The
  player's cards are both face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one
  face down (hidden).
- Player's Turn:
  - If the player's initial two cards total 21 (an Ace and a 10-value card), this
    is called a "Blackjack." The player wins 3:2 on their bet immediately,
    unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case the game ends.
  - If not a Blackjack, the player has the option to "Hit" (request additional
    cards) one at a time to try to get closer to 21. The player can hit as many
    times as they like but will "Bust" (automatically lose) if their total exceeds

21.

- The player can also "Stand" (not take any more cards) if they are satisfied
  with their hand's total value.

- Dealer's Turn: After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. The
  dealer must hit if their total is less than 17 and stand once it reaches 17 or more.
- Determining the Winner:
  - If the dealer busts or the player's total is closer to 21 than the dealer's
    without exceeding 21, the player wins and doubles their bet.
  - If both the player and the dealer have the same total, the game is a
    "Push" (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
  - If the dealer has a higher total than the player without busting, or if the
    player busts, the player loses their bet.
